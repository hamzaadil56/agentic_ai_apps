# Agentic AI Applications

Welcome to the **Agentic AI Applications** repository! This project is dedicated to exploring the development of agentic AI applications, focusing on concepts, features, and practical implementations.

## What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning to autonomously solve complex, multi-step problems. Unlike traditional AI, which often requires human intervention for task execution, agentic AI systems can independently analyze challenges, develop strategies, and execute tasks across various domains.
